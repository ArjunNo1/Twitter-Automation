3,"Why people hesitate to opt Civil Engineering course nowadays???
The Civil Engineering graduates are jobless is the answer.
Is this true??
Not at all. Even in this pandemic situation there are lots of vacancies for Civil Engineer Job.
Then where does the pblm arise?
It is in the mind of people. We always believe what we hear.
If we analyse before we believe,we can determine the truth.
The truth is ,the mindset of the people should be changed.
Civil Engineering is an evergreen field where varieties of jobs are available. The students are free to choose the field that suits them the best.
If a student studies well during the course of study and if the student gains more practical knowledge during the four years of the course and if the student is willing to take up the job with full positive mindset and if the student is able to manage and copeup with the timings during his/her work then the student will definitely be a successful Civil Engineer.
This is the only field that gives life to non-living materials like building, bridge,dams etc.
The only field that makes many entrepreneurs is Civil Engineering.
Rather than sitting in AC Room and working,it gives a heartfelt satisfaction when you create a AC Room for others to sit and work. This can be felt only by a Civil Engineer.
If you change your mindset and if you learn more and practice more you can become a successful Civil Engineer/Entrepreneur.
Civil Engineers create footprint wherever they go.The buildings that we construct are our Pride.Be proud to be a Civil Engineer.
A successful path is approaching you,be ready to travel in it with full of enthusiasm.
